# Homework 2 - What do SARS-Cov-2 genes do?

In the first homework, we wrote an algorithm to retrieve ORFs from the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Some retrieved ORFs may correspond to the actual genes, some were there by chance, and some because the start codon also encodes for methionine, so the retrieved ORF was a (short) part of the more extended coding sequence. We used protein hydrophobicity to find potential transmembrane proteins. But what about other types of proteins? How can we tell which ORFs correspond to the actual genes?
